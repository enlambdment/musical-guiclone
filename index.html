    <h1>musical button grid</h1>

    <!-- I think we need a start button that the user can
         press in order to begin.
         We will equip this button with an event listener 
         which, upon click, calls Tone.start().
         This will return a promise which must be resolved 
         in order for an AudioContext to run, and the audio
         synthesis to work. -->
    <button class="start-btn">
      Start! 🔊
    </button>
    
    <!-- We also need a button to play back for us what we have so far.
         In the coconet GUI, this serves a double function as play / stop 
         button depending on whether audio is currently playing or not
         (which we track with a global variable I think?) 
         Here we will do likewise. -->
    <button class="playpause-btn">
      Play ▶️ / Stop ⏹️
    </button>
    
    <!-- And a button for the infill action, which is the element for us
         to equip with an event listener that will prompt additional music
         generation. -->
    <button class="infill-btn">
      Infill 📝
    </button>
    
    <!-- A horizontal separator to set the control buttons
         apart from the musical GUI. -->
    <hr>
    
    <!-- Upon page rendering, this element is filled with the grid of 
         buttons which make up the musical GUI. -->

    <!-- For error handling. -->

       ES6: use type="module" along with slightly modified import syntax in the 
       main script.js. Hope this works? -->
