prototype
=================

Expose a simplified version of the musical GUI via [coconet](https://coconet.glitch.me/#) -
* no machine learning model
* only two voices 
* when a note is input in one voice, only the consonant pitches in the other voice should be available for selection


Your Project
------------

In principle, should consist only of:

### ← README.md

(i.e. this file itself)

### ← index.html

(i.e. where I'll write the contents of the single-page site)

### ← style.css

(add styling rules to my content)

### ← script.js

(this is where interactivity will come from)
