===============

[coucou](https://coconet.glitch.me/#) is a website which describes and provides access to 
experimentation with a neural network trained to provide completions of four-part harmofor melodic material that the user provides, via a clickable grid of buttons which the GUI exposes.

The main objectives of this project were to:
* work backwards from the original page and "reverse engineer" the essential functionality
* replace the code importing a pre-trained model with my own, simpler JavaScript for 
  providing completion of two-part harmony using a more rudimentary probabilistic approach
* experiment with different solutions for bringing in 3rd-party libraries as dependencies
